Hi! This is personal page.

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a predoctoral researcher at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M, Spain). For this research experience, I got funded by the FPU fellowship program (University Faculty Training Program by the Spanish Universities Ministry) to join the Statistics Department as a Ph.D. Candidate in Mathematical Engineering. Before joining the department, I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Statistics at Universidad de Granada in 2021, while working as a research assistant for the Computer Science department at UC3M. From 2016 to 2020, I also followed my bachelor's degree in Statistics and Business at UC3M. The interdisciplinarity of my educational background generated a wide range of research interests for me: from machine learning and probabilistic forecasting to data-driven optimization and energy market problems, a field on which I am more focused during my predoctoral stage. </div>
