**[01/12/2021]:** I've been granted the FPU fellowship by the Spanish Universities Ministries. This is a highly competitive fellowship (only 15 opportunities for predoctoral researchers in mathematical fields) that will allow me to develop my research as a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematical Engineering at UC3M. I will be supervised by Prof. [Carlos Ruiz Mora](https://carlosruizmora.github.io) to work in data-driven optimization methods for solving energy market problems. </div>

**[15/01/2021]:** From January 2021, I'm starting a new position as a research assistant for the Computer Science Department at UC3M, under the supervision of professors [Ricardo Aler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WTFavwQAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Inés M. Galván](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=shgFBjgAAAAJ). We will work in probabilistic forecasting methods and we will apply our advances in the field of renewable energy forecasting.
